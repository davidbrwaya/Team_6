#Questions for Analysis:

1. How does the relationship between Very Active Distance and Very Active Minutes vary across different individuals in the dataset, and are there any patterns or trends that emerge when examining this relationship over time?

2.Is there any correlation between total distance and calories?

3.How does the distribution of weight in pounds vary among different ranges of total minutes asleep? Could a pie chart effectively illustrate the proportion of weight categories (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight) within specific intervals of total minutes asleep?
